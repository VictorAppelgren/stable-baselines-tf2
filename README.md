# stable-baselines-tf2
The original [stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) repo only supports TF1.x.\
This repo makes a few modifications to make stable-baseline compatible with TF2.x while keeping the rest of the code logic intact.

## Installation Instruction
- Follow the instructions in the [original repo](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baseline) to install stable-baselines;
